# Demographic Analysis of Camden, England

Over the past few decades, governments and organizations have put a great deal of effort into understanding the population they serve. They continue to analyze data to understand trends and patterns in demographics and how they have changed over time. The purpose of this project is to collect demographic data from the Camden district in London, England, analyze the data, find significant trends, and develop a prediction model.

## About Demographic Data

Demographic data refers to data about a population that describes its characteristics. It includes details such as age, sex, race, socioeconomic status (employment status, income, education level, marital status, birth, and death rates), etc. This information is an excellent way to learn about the characteristics of a population in focus. Governments use this data to make policies and decisions for the benefit of the population, while organizations use it to understand their customer base and predict future trends or sales based on consumer demand. With the advent of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques, this data has become increasingly useful for analyzing and formulating strategies for governments and businesses.

## About Camden

Camden is a district in London, England, home to many famous people, including Charles Dickens, John Keats, and several celebrities.

The dataset includes information on 106 parameters for the people of Camden, including their age, religion, ethnicity, education, employment status, household information, economic activities, status of residence, etc.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to examine the demographic data for Camden, England. The spatial analysis will lead to understanding important trends about the mentioned attributes and how they affect the major population in the city. Fields like employment, occupation, education, and qualifications will be the main focus of the study. The project aims to identify the relationship between these features for the population and find the variables that are interrelated and affect each other. Regional analysis will also be performed, even within the smaller regions of Camden, to identify the areas of the district that are doing well compared to others on different parameters. Ultimately, the project aims to develop a prediction model to predict the employment status of the residents based on other parameters like education and residence status.

## Conclusion

This project will help understand the demographic trends and patterns in the Camden district of London, England. The analysis will provide insights into the major population attributes like employment, occupation, education, and qualifications.
